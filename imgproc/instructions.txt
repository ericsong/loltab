In order to make some images, first:

	cmake .
	make

then, run the program by:

	./DisplayImage <name of image>

Any numbers or images that are guessed incorrectly, place with a unique name into their respective folders in the folder:

	../1080p/characters/
	
	or

	../1080p/faded_characters/

	or

	../champions/

	or

	../items/

	or

	../summoners/

and check to see if it works by running the program again.
