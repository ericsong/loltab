-create script that runs through .flv and prints tag data...
ex...
"TAG FOUND: TYPE - AUDIO, LOCATION - 1239, SIZE - 100"
also get # of bytes cut off by the last frame. 
also list if VIDEO tag is a keyframe or not
-prepend first part of cut off frame onto the next .flv.
-try playing. (probably won't work because of the nature of frame prediction)
-try splitting by keyframes
